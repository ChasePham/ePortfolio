                Right now, I am a Junior at the University of Texas at Austin studying Neuroscience where I recently
                 made the transition from pursuing pre-med to SWE. While I am not a CS major, I try my best to take as many classes relevant to my career goals, and 
                 focus my own time to learn new CS concepts. My long term goals are not fully set in stone, but right now I am interested to learning more
                 about the data science field and potentially lead into working with Deep Learning technology :)
